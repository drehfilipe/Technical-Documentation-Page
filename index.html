            <p>Welcome to Blender! Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite.</p>
            <p>With Blender, you can create 3D visualizations such as still images, 3D animations, VFX shots, and video
                editing. It is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and
                responsive development process.</p>
            <p>Being a cross-platform application, Blender runs on Linux, macOS, as well as Windows systems. It also has
                relatively small memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites. Its interface uses
                OpenGL to provide a consistent experience across all supported hardware and platforms.</p>

            <p>Blender has a wide variety of tools making it suitable for almost any sort of media production. People
                and studios around the world use it for hobby projects, commercials, and feature films.</p>

            <header id="Blender_History">Blender's History</header>
            <p>In 1988, Ton Roosendaal co-founded the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo. NeoGeo quickly became the largest
                3D animation studio in the Netherlands and one of the leading animation houses in Europe. NeoGeo created
                award-winning productions (European Corporate Video Awards 1993 and 1995) for large corporate clients
                such as the multinational electronics company Philips. Within NeoGeo, Ton was responsible for both art
                direction and internal software development. After careful deliberation, Ton decided that the current
                in-house 3D tool set for NeoGeo was too old and cumbersome to maintain, and needed to be rewritten from
                scratch. In 1995 this rewrite began and was destined to become the 3D software creation we all know as
                Blender. As NeoGeo continued to refine and improve Blender, it became apparent to Ton that Blender could
                be used as a tool for other artists outside of NeoGeo.</p>
            <p>In 1998, Ton decided to found a new company called Not a Number (NaN) as a spin-off of NeoGeo to further
                market and develop Blender. At the core of NaN was a desire to create and distribute a compact,
                cross-platform 3D application for free. At the time, this was a revolutionary concept as most commercial
                3D applications cost thousands of dollars. NaN hoped to bring professional level 3D modeling and
                animation tools within the reach of the general computing public. NaN’s business model involved
                providing commercial products and services around Blender. In 1999 NaN attended its first SIGGRAPH
                conference in an effort to more widely promote Blender. Blender’s first SIGGRAPH convention was a huge
                success and gathered a tremendous amount of interest from both the press and attendees. Blender was a
                hit and its huge potential confirmed!</p>
            <p>Following the success of the SIGGRAPH conference in early 2000, NaN secured financing of €4.5M from
                venture capitalists. This large inflow of cash enabled NaN to rapidly expand its operations. Soon NaN
                boasted as many as 50 employees working around the world trying to improve and promote Blender. In the
                summer of 2000, Blender 2.0 was released. This version of Blender added the integration of a game engine
                to the 3D application. By the end of 2000, the number of users registered on the NaN website exceeded
                250,000.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, NaN’s ambitions and opportunities did not match the company’s capabilities and the market
                realities of the time. This over-extension resulted in restarting NaN with new investor funding and a
                smaller company in April 2001. Six months later NaN’s first commercial software product, Blender
                Publisher was launched. This product was targeted at the emerging market of interactive web-based 3D
                media. Due to disappointing sales and the ongoing difficult economic climate, the new investors decided
                to shut down all NaN operations. The shutdown also included discontinuing the development of Blender.
                Although there were clearly shortcomings in the then current version of Blender, such as a complex
                internal software architecture, unfinished features and a non-standard way of providing the GUI, the
                enthusiastic support from the user community and customers who had purchased Blender Publisher in the
                past, meant that Ton could not justify leaving Blender to fade into insignificance. Since restarting a
                company with a sufficiently large team of developers was not feasible, Ton Roosendaal founded the
                non-profit organization, Blender Foundation, in March 2002.</p>
            <p>The Blender Foundation’s primary goal was to find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a
                community-based open source project. In July 2002, Ton managed to get the NaN investors to agree to a
                unique Blender Foundation plan to attempt to release Blender as open source. The “Free Blender” campaign
                sought to raise €100,000 so that the Foundation could buy the rights to the Blender source code and
                intellectual property rights from the NaN investors and subsequently release Blender to the open source
                community. With an enthusiastic group of volunteers, among them several ex-NaN employees, a fundraising
                campaign was launched to “Free Blender”. To everyone’s surprise and delight the campaign reached the
                €100,000 goal in only seven short weeks. On Sunday, October 13, 2002, Blender was released to the world
                under the terms of the GNU GPL. Blender development continues to this day, driven by a team of dedicated
                volunteers from around the world led by Blender’s original creator, Ton Roosendaal.</p>
